# Different types of Databases?

Databases are the backbone of our digital world. They store and organise data in a way that makes it easy for us to access and use.

There are many different types of databases, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Check out a few here ⬇️

- 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 are good for storing data with complex relationships, such as social networks.

- 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 are the most common type of database and are good for storing structured data, such as customer records.

- 𝐎𝐋𝐀𝐏 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 are good for analysing large amounts of data.

- 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 are good for storing unstructured data, such as web pages.

- 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐦𝐧-𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 are good for storing data that is often queried by column.

- 𝐊𝐞𝐲-𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 are good for storing data that is accessed by a unique key.

- 𝐎𝐑𝐌 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬 make it easier to work with databases by providing a layer of abstraction between the code and the database.

Each type has its strengths and optimal use cases. The database landscape continues to evolve, adapting to the ever-growing demands of modern applications!
