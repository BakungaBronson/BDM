# Task 1: Portfolio

You are required to produce your portfolio. A portfolio is a compilation of materials that exemplifies your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences. It provides insight into your personality and work ethic. A portfolio website is generally a static website featuring work samples and other details as explained above. It is closely related to [Online Resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_portfolio) or [C.V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae). You can see a [sample portfolio here](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).

## Folder Structure
You must place your portfolio in the Portfolio folder. Within the [`portfolio`](./portfolio) folder, create a folder called your `github_id`. Name the default file as `readme.md`. You can add any file related to your portfolio. Suggested folder structure for this project:

A folder structure for portfolio as below:

```
📁 portfolio
├── 📁BakungaBronson
│   ├── 📄readme.md
│   └── 📄image.png
├── 📁HazemFenneer
│   ├── 📄readme.md
│   └── 📄image1.png
...
└── 📁zuhayraz
    ├── 📄readme.md
    └── 📄image.png
```
